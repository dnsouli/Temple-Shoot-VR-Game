## Game Description

The story revolves around a temple arena in the middle of a jungle that has been cursed by spirits that have taken the form of evil masks. In order to lift the curse, the player must find and physically destroy the masks with their trusty handgun. In order to summon the masks, the player must step on each of the colored skull platforms. The curse has also risen some bodies from the dead in the form of skeleton warriors that will hunt the player down around the map while the player tries to reach each platform.

To summarize, the goal of the game is to get as many points as possible by shooting down the evil masks. Each mask will grant the player five points. The player will begin the game facing one of the four instructional screens that will tell the player to go to a specified colored platform as well as their current score. These screens also hold the user interface buttons that will allow the player to retry or quit the current game session. 

Once the player reaches a colored platform, a barrier will appear along with another screen that will show the player how much time they will have left to shoot the masks. After the time is up, they can move on to the next platform while making sure they don’t run into any roaming enemies. These skeleton warriors will walk towards and attack the player if they get close, costing them five points if hit. The player cannot destroy these enemies. Once all platforms’ shooting galleries have been played, the player will be sent to the end screen which will display their total score along with the options to retry or go back to the title screen.
